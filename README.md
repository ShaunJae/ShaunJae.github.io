## Projects

These are some of my projects. I picked the most digestable or visually appealing. Many of my other projects either don't have any GUI or are things like machine learning programs that are hard to show working. Feel free to contact me and ask more about any of my projects or other projects that I have.

* ### [30 Minute Snake](https://shaunj.itch.io/30-minute-snake)

A simple game of snake coded in 30 minutes. Developed in LUA using Love2D

* ### [Hotdog Emitter](/Projects/HotDogEmitter/)

An odd program I made years back that emitts hotdogs (or any image you want) from a single point with various settings. Developed in HTML and JS

* ### [Mini Jam 74 Tech Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0kmpNYvidc)

A project from a game jam I participated in. Uses gravity to push dust particles away from the player. The player could then collapse them into asteroids and planets. I didnt finish but learned a lot about optimization and project managment. Developed in LUA using Love2D
